This repository contains a README file sample for Daytona Samples and the MIT License.

It can be used as a template to create sample repositories that can be added into [Daytona](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona).

Once you finish your sample and it gets merged, you can open a PR in the Daytona repo and submit the sample into the [index file](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona/blob/main/hack/samples/index.json).
